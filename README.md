This application is a springboot application that uses Elasticsearch to store data as Json Documents and allows users to run queries against the data and use aggregations to retrieve summaries of their data.
The application has two documents ie. Person and Vehicle whose data has been indexed into Elasticsearch 
To run this application, simply run the main java class "ElasticSearchApplication" and any REST client can be used to send queries and get responses for either of the two instances
